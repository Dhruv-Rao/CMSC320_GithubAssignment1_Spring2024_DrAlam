I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I am really passionate about the merge point of computer science and statistics. For as long as I can remember, I have loved math, and during high school, I grew to love computer science too. Statistics is my means of analyzing trends in data and identifying problems, and computer science is how i can create large-scale solutions for these problems efficiently. Since I have delved so deeply into these fields on my own time, when I came to UMD I decided to study both computer science and statistics. While I have done some data science on my own, I am very excited for this class because it is my first formal education in the area. It should be a good way to build on my existing skills and develop new ones.
